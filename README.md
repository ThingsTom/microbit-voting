# Micro:bit Voting

This repository contains code to use the Micro:bit as part of a voting system.

### Python
Uses the Micro:bit as a receiver, transmitter(s) and controller using Radio (RF) communication.

### JavaScript
Uses the Microbit as a receiver(s) and transmitter(s) using Radio (RF) and Bluetooth (Eddystone) communication, Pixl.js as receiver(s), and/or Node-RED as a receiver.

Each implementation includes the hex file for easier uploading onto a Micro:Bit.
